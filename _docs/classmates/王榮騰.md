Laung-Terng (L.-T.) Wang, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of SynTest Technologies (San Jose, CA), is also a distinguished chair professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, the Department of Creative Informatics at Kyushu Institute of Technology, and the School of Software at Tsinghua University. He received his BSEE and MSEE degrees from National Taiwan University in 1975 and 1977, respectively, and his MSEE and EE Ph.D. degrees under the Honors Cooperative Program (HCP) from Stanford University in 1982 and 1987, respectively. He worked at Intel (Santa Clara, CA) and Daisy Systems (Mountain View, CA) from 1980 to 1986 and was with the Department of Electrical Engineering of Stanford University as Research Associate and Lecturer from 1987 to 1991.

Encouraged by his advisor and professor Edward J. McCluskey, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, Dr. Wang founded SynTest Technologies in 1990. The design-for-testability (DFT) technologies Dr. Wang has developed have been successfully implemented in thousands of ASIC designs worldwide. He currently holds more than 50 U.S. Patents, 4 Japan Patents, 2 European Patents (each registered in Britain, Germany, and France), and 2 Chinese Patents in the areas of scan synthesis, test generation, at-speed scan testing, test compression, logic built-in self-test (BIST), and design for debug-and-diagnosis (DFD).

Dr. Wang spearheaded efforts on raising over $6 million to also honor his undergraduate advisor and NTU chair professor Irving T. Ho (Stanford Ph.D., 1961), and his graduate advisor and Stanford professor Edward J. McCluskey (MIT ScD, 1956). Since 2003, he has helped establish a number of endowed chair professorships, graduate fellowships, and undergraduate scholarships at Stanford University, National Taiwan University, Tsinghua University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He also co-authored and led to edit three internationally used DFT/EDA textbooks – [VLSI Test Principles and Architectures — Design for Testability](https://www.elsevier.com/books/vlsi-test-principles-and-architectures/wang/978-0-12-370597-6) (2006), [System-on-Chip Test Architectures — Nanometer Design for Testability](https://www.elsevier.com/books/system-on-chip-test-architectures/wang/978-0-12-373973-5) (2007), and [Electronic Design Automation — Synthesis, Verification, and Test](https://www.elsevier.com/books/electronic-design-automation/wang/978-0-12-374364-0) (2009) – with sales over 4,500 copies by December 2009.

A member of Sigma Xi, Dr. Wang received a 2007 Meritorious Service Award from the IEEE Computer Society and is a co-recipient of the 2008 IEICE Information and Systems Society Excellent Paper Award for an excellent series of papers that appeared in IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems during a period of five years. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, a Golden Core Member of the IEEE Computer Society, and served on the 2010 and 2011 IEEE Computer Society Fellow Evaluation Committee.

In 2019, Dr. Wang received a Distinguished Alumni Award from NTU – [Spotlight: 2019 臺大傑出校友: 「獻身公益的矽谷創業家」王榮騰](/files/2019臺大傑出校友_王榮騰.pdf). He further received a Distinguished Alumni Award from National Tainan First Senior High School, Taiwan, in 2024 - [Spotlight: 2024 臺南一中「第16屆校友傑出成就獎專輯」王榮騰](/files/2024臺南一中第16屆校友傑出成就獎專輯-王榮騰.PNG).
